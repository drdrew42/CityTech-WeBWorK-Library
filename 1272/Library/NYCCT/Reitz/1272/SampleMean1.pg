## randomize parameter n (number of trials)
## need to make sure either than n>=30, or state in the text that the original population is normally distributed
$n = random(30,100);

## randomize mean and standard deviation - original population
$mu = random(62,78);
$sigma = random(4,8,0.01);

## compute mean mu_xbar and standard deviation sigma_xbar - for sampling distribution
$mu_xbar = $mu;
$sigma_xbar = $sigma/sqrt($n);

## choose x bounds
## we will make sure corresponding values of z lie between z=-3.49 and z=3.49 
## we will choose x's between these values to ensure we can use the table
## first compute bounds for x-values corresponding to z +- 3.49 --
$xtablebound[0] = ceil($mu_xbar - 3.49*$sigma_xbar);
$xtablebound[1] = floor($mu_xbar +3.49*$sigma_xbar);

##  choose integer x0 and x1 -- these will be used for lower bound and upper bound of interval, respectively (as well as lower/upper bounds for intervals to infinity)
## IMPROVEMENTS - modify to allow non-integer bounds
$x[0] = random($xtablebound[0],$xtablebound[1]-1);
$x[1] = random($x[0]+1,$xtablebound[1]);

## compute answers

## first compute z-values, then round to 2 decimals
$z[0] = ($x[0] - $mu_xbar)/$sigma_xbar;
$z[0] = Round($z[0],2);
$z[1] = ($x[1] - $mu_xbar)/$sigma_xbar;
$z[1] = Round($z[1],2);

## now compute probability for each z, round each answer to 4 decimals
## note for problems involving two x-values, this ensures that rounding takes place for each corresponding probability value, as it does in table-based computations (computing the area between z-values and then rounding may not yield the same result)

$prob[0] = Round(normal_prob('-infty',$z[0]), 4);
$prob[1] = Round(normal_prob('-infty',$z[1]), 4);

## now compute various answers - above x0, below x1, and between x0 and x1
## choose the answer appropriate to your problem and include it in the ANS code below

$ansAbovex0 = 1 - $prob[0];
$ansBelowx1 = $prob[1];
$ansBetweenx0Andx1 = $prob[1] - $prob[0];

BEGIN_TEXT

Assume that the average height of men in a large city is \( $mu \) inches with a standard deviation of \( $sigma \) inches.  A random sample of \( $n \) men in this city is selected, and the mean height of the sample is computed.  What is the probability that the sample mean is between \( $x[0] \) and \( $x[1] \)?  \{ ans_rule(10) \}
